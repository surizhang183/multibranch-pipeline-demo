# multibranch-pipeline-demo
A multi-branch pipeline is a concept of automatically creating Jenkins pipelines based on Git branches. Meaning, it can automatically discover new branches in the source control (Github) and automatically creates a pipeline for that branch. When the pipeline build starts, Jenkins uses the Jenkinsfile in that branch for build stages.
